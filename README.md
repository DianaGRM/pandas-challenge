# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I worked with pandas library to analyze a schools and students csv files.
To start working the data, I merged the two csv files so it would be easier to work, 
each data frame requested in the challenge was included and at the begging of the file I summarized the results
and included conclusions of the information.
