    "## summary and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This database contains information from 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students. The database also has more specific information about each school and student, for example, grade, gender, math score, reading score, school budget, size, and type. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the data frame \"district summary\"  we analyze the data from the schools in general, in which we can see that 74.98% of all students pass math and 85.80% pass reading, but only 65.17% of the students pass math and reading. We can also see the average score in each subject, total budget, total students, and total schools.In the second data frame \"School summary\" you can find the same information as the 1 data frame but in specific for all schools in addition to the budget per student and school type. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following data frames show the top and bottom 5 schools per overall passing percentage.  In the top 5 schools, more than 90% of their students pass the two subjects and the difference between the average math and reading score is by decimals (in all cases math scores are lower). In difference with the lowest performing schools only less than 54% of the students pass both subjects, the average math scores are significantly lower than the average reading scores, less than 67% of the students pass math. One thing that we can conclude from this comparison is that to for the majority of students, math may be more difficult than reading and that surprisingly the bottom schools have more budget per student than the top schools, but these schools are smaller in size and charter-type which means that maybe they can put more attention to each student, instead of the bottom schools that are district-type and with a bigger amount of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two successive data frames show the average score for each subject by grade in each school. the average didn´t have a significate change during the grades, the difference was less than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spending ranges analysis per student, you can see that the less they spend, the higher the scores get and the same thing happens in the scores by school size analysis in which it´s shown that the smallest the school is the better the students do in the scores. In the end, the analysis of the scores by school type was done, and the charter schools had significantly higher scores and percentages of passing than the district schools. These last conclusions can support the third paragraph´s idea."
